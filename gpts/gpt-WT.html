What is the penalty for drafting in a standard distance elite triathlon?

GPT Answer:
Drafting is penalized with a blue card. The athlete must serve a 1-minute time penalty in the Penalty Box 
on the run course. This is clearly outlined in the 2025 World Triathlon Competition Rules under 
Rule 5.6.1 and 3.3.
