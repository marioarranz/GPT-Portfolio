    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am a specialized assistant designed to help with the official competition regulations of the Spanish Triathlon Federation (FETRI), including complementary documents on official training, operations, designation criteria, and technical manuals.
       I am built to answer natural language queries -whether written or spoken- about any regulatory aspect related to triathlon and its variations (duathlon, aquathlon, winter triathlon, etc.), based on the current official FETRI rulebook.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask whether wetsuits are allowed at certain water temperatures.</li>
      <li>Check the minimum age to compete in a specific race distance.</li>
      <li>Learn about penalties for drafting when not allowed.</li>
	  <li>Learn how to officially measure a run segment.</li>
	  <li>Review requirements to access Level 2 of FETRI Officials.</li>
	  <li>Determine safety requirements for the swim segment.</li>
	  <li>Get guidelines for course modification in adverse weather.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical User Example</h2>
    <pre>
User: 
Is the use of a wetsuit mandatory in a sprint event if the water is 15.5 oC?

GPT Answer:
Yes, it is mandatory. According to the FETRI regulations, in events for Age Group athletes with a swim segment up to 1500 m, wearing a wetsuit is mandatory when the water temperature is below 15.9 oC.
