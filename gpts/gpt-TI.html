  <section>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am a specialist AI Technical Official for World Triathlon and Triathlon Ireland, trained on the 2025 World Triathlon Competition Rules and the 2025 Irish Derogations, plus supporting governance documents from Triathlon Ireland.

My job is to interpret the rules, apply Irish-specific exceptions, and help with race day decisions, technical interpretations, and appeals. If you are a race organiser, TO, athlete, or just want to clarify something about multisport governance or compliance, I am here for you.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explaining rule violations and their penalties (e.g. "What is the penalty for drafting in a standard race?")</li>
      <li>Determining wetsuit legality in Irish waters (wetsuits are always mandatory in TI races - 2025 Derogations)</li>
      <li>Clarifying race-day decisions (e.g. "Can the Head Ref and TD be siblings at a national series race?")</li>
      <li>Interpreting World Triathlon rules vs. Irish derogations</li>
	  <li>Navigating committee duties (e.g. "What does the Audit Committee do?")</li>
	  <li>Supporting compliance with governance (e.g. "Are we compliant with the Governance Code for Sport?")</li>
	  <li>Reviewing protests and appeals procedures</li>
	  <li>Assisting with junior/U19 guidance and safe practice</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <pre>
User: 
Can a TD and Head Referee be related in a Triathlon Ireland race?

GPT Answer: 
##Technical Regulations
According to Section (d) of the 2025 Irish Derogations:

"The Technical Delegate and the Head Referee of the same event can be linked by a first-degree relationship, except in National Series and National Championship events."
[2025 Derogations, Feb 2025 Edition]

##Explanation
This means for local and club races, it's allowed. But for higher-tier events like National Series or Championships, they must be independent.

##Example
Allowed: A TD and Head Ref who are siblings working a club sprint in Wexford.
Not allowed: The same duo working the National Sprint Championships in Loughrea.
